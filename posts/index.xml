&lt;p>What is the difference between life and death? How does one even go about answering this question? If we want to talk about these concepts we have to clearly define the difference between the two. The thoughts that come to mind when mentioning these ideas are diverse and vary on culture, religion, and ideology. Is it possible for us to agree on what it means to be alive, and what it means to be dead? I believe we all share a general common understanding of what it means it be alive, and to be dead, and I will try and tease this out in the following section.&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="starting-definitions">Starting Definitions&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>Let&amp;rsquo;s be methodical about our apporach. Maybe we should define living biologically? This seems like an obvious start, but after some consideration, you will realize some problems. A living person needs a pulse surely, but it needs more than just that. A pacemaker can keep the heartbeat of a person without even a brain, but that person isn&amp;rsquo;t really alive.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The brain needs to be functioning or atleast have the potential to function, for the person to be alive. All the other parts are nice additions but they don&amp;rsquo;t define your living experience. A person with artificial lungs, heart, or other organs can still be alive aslong as the brain is good. Let&amp;rsquo;s go a step deeper.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When a person says they are &amp;ldquo;alive&amp;rdquo;, they don&amp;rsquo;t just mean that the biological functioning of their brain is in working condition. They really mean they are conscious and in the moment. Your last moments of your life are your last conscious moments afterall. What I am trying to get at is I believe that consciousness is the component that makes a person alive. You may be hesitant to agree to this, but then you are left with some unsettling questions. Would you trade away your consciousness for some dollar amount? Most likely not, but why. That&amp;rsquo;s because a life without consciousness is unimaginable. I would go further and say that a life without consciousness is a nonsense concept. People have a natural inclination to see their conscious experience as proof of their existence, and the factor that seperates their existence from that of an object. You don&amp;rsquo;t just exist in the most materialistic sense, like how a rock exists, &lt;em>but you exist as a thing that is aware of it&amp;rsquo;s existence&lt;/em>. Thinking about life in this way, we can see that the bioligical component doesn&amp;rsquo;t have much to do with our definition at all. Biological components do add to your experience through senses, but being robbed from any of the senses doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean you aren&amp;rsquo;t alive. The two points I wish to take away from all this is that&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Consciousness is a necessary component for life.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>The biological workings of living entities are irrelevant, they are just important inso-far they facilitate consciousness.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>Some additional thoughts,&lt;/p>
&lt;p>At this point, you might wonder what is consciousness. Finding the true nature of consciousness is something science and philospohy still hasn&amp;rsquo;t pinned down. Luckily, for the sake of my argument that doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter, aslong as we all agree that it exists, and a living person has it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A conscious experience isn&amp;rsquo;t really a life, it&amp;rsquo;s a string of conscious experiences that makes up your life. Let&amp;rsquo;s be specific and say that a stream of conscioussness is what makes up life, since practically no life (excpet maybe a very short one) is made up of just one experience.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="what-else">What else?&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>A stream of conscioussness only makes sense if it has something to operate on. You are a person in the world with a personality, likes, dislikes, desires, fears, and so on. The totality of that data is what makes you, You. So a stream of consciousness needs a context to exist in, and that context is you and the world you inhabit. This may seem obvious but it is important for completeness sake. This also means a stream of consciousness in a world of nothing is meaningless, since you couldn&amp;rsquo;t experience anything.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Outside of these things I have mentioned, there are no other factors I see necessitated by life. If you are religious or believe in a non-materialist worldview you might add something like the soul. I take a materialist view and assume you will too, so I won&amp;rsquo;t add anything supernatural to the equation. Finally, lets write down what we have discovered. I will slightly adjust our statements above to match where we are at.&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Consciousness is the necessary component for life.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>A living person is defined by their stream of consciousness and the context they live in. (personality, DNA, their environment, etc&amp;hellip;)&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>The biological workings of living entities are irrelevant, they are just important inso-far they facilitate consciousness. Infact, everything except (1) and (2) is irrelelvant.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>If we end here, we are left at a troubling position. If sleep disrupts your stream of consciousness, then don&amp;rsquo;t we die everytime we fall asleep? This sounds like some technicality based on our definition, &amp;ldquo;Oh yea, technically we die in our sleep if you want to say that, but real death is something very different from sleep. You can&amp;rsquo;t wake up from death&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p></content></item></channel></rss>
